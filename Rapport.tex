Problem1: Calculate $\langle X^2\rangle$ for both correlated and uncorrelated velocities by setting $p=1/2, p=1\%$ and $p=10\%$. Calculate the ensemble average with $10^5$ realizations and use $N = 1000$.
}

In figure ?? we can see the difference between the $p$ values.
Low values of $p$ makes the walker goes further. 

{\color{black!70}2. Make a logarithmic plot, i.e.e plot the variance 
$\log_{10}(\langle\Delta X^2 \rangle))$ as a function of $\log_{10}$ 
with $t = i$ and identify linear portions of the graphs. Discuss the 
corresponding early time exponents of $p=1\%$ and $p=10\%$ graphs and
why they change at later times. 
}

Figure ?? shows $\log_{10}(\langle\Delta X^2 \rangle))$ for the two cases. 
By looking at $\langle X^2\rangle$ it is hard to interpret what is happening,
 but now we see clear plateaus. This suggest that after the walkers
has walked a certain amount of steps it stops moving and holds a mean 
position around this point. 

The function $n^2 - (n-1)^2 = 2n-1$ is also shown in the plot. This is to
compare the walkers to a walker which has no chance of turning around.
In this simple case the mentioned function is the analytical solution. 

Another way to interpret this is to say that the start of the plateu
is a kind of characteristic length for when the walker becomes a 
random walker with $p = 0.5$. The same plot for $p = 0.5$ are not shown
but only holds constant value at all steps. 

{\color{black!70} 3. For $p=0.5$, show that we may write 
$\langle\Delta X^2 \rangle = 2Dt$ and identify the value of $D$.
